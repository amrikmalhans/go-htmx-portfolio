          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            Programming has been my passion since I was 15 years old, I started
            learning how to code myself and I have been doing it ever since. I
            got addicted to programming that I started skipping classes to find
            time to code. <br />
            <br />
            I started doing freelancing in high school at the age of 16 and I
            got my first SWE job at the age of 17.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            I love music, I listen to a lot of different genres and have
            actually made a song myself. I play guitar (although still learning)
            and I wanna be able to make my own music one day. <br />
            <br />
            I am into the genres of dream pop, indie rock, bedroom pop, rap, emo
            rap, and alternative rock.

          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <p>
            I love to travel and explore new places. I have been to 2 different
            countries so far and I am planning to visit Japan next summer.
            <br />
            <br />
            My dream is to travel the world and visit every country (kind of a
            far fetched dream, but that's what dreaming is all about).
