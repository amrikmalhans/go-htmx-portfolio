Ours efforts do not hold 100% of the outcome, we cannot control how things will come out at the end.

> Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces than individual effort.

The book goes over the story of Bill Gates, he was one the very few children who had access to a computer in his high-school in the 90s, the chance of having that access was 1 in a million, and one of his friends, who would be the future founding partner of his company, died in a mountaineering accident, of which the chances are 1 in a million.

Both these are the side of this luck and risk equation - one of them got lucky with the computer and founded a trillion dollar company, and the other died in an accident, which was a risk.

**Two things to learn from this:**

1. **Not 100% of the outcomes can be attributed solely to effort and decision making.**

> Not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness, keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.
> 

1. **Focus less on specific individuals, and more on broad patterns.**

> You’ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad patterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern, the more applicable it might be to your life.
> 

Instead of looking at the success stories of individuals, we should look at a broad spectrum of people and try to find a pattern which is more constructive and approachable, and has a higher chance of success. 

When you’re looking at specific success stories, you’re usually looking at someone’s luck & risk equation and everything else. 

> When things are going extremely well, realize it’s not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then you have to believe in luck’s cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly.
