# Amrik Malhans Portfolio

View website at [https://amrik-portfolio.up.railway.app/](https://amrik-portfolio.up.railway.app/)

This is my personal portfolio website assigment for school. It is quite simple as it uses only HTML and CSS to build these 4 pages:

- index.html (Home)
- hobbies.html (Hobbies)
- work.html (Work)
- schedule.html (Schedule)

## Getting Started

The HTML portfolio is served with a [Go server](https://golang.org/). To run the server, you must have Go installed on your machine. You can download Go [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, you can run the server by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start the server on port 8080. You can access the website by going to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Note - If you don't want to use the Go server you can simply open individual HTML files in your browser.

The HTML pages are located in the `web/templates` directory. You can open these individual files in your browser to view the website.

## HTML File Structure

These are the files that make up the website:

- `index.html` - Home page of the website
- `hobbies.html` - Hobbies page of the website
- `work.html` - Work page of the website
- `schedule.html` - Schedule page of the website using HTML table
